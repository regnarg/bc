We explore the problem of file synchronization, with the goal of improving on
the efficiency, scalability, robustness, flexibility and security of current
file synchronization tools. We solve several important subproblems that may
help this, especially in the areas of filesystem change detection (both
online and offline) and peer-to-peer synchronization of file metadata.  We
show techniques to make scanning a file system for changes faster and more
reliable.  We extend the Linux kernel's `fanotify` filesystem change
notification API to report more events, especially renames. We present
several original solutions to the set reconciliation problem and its variants
and apply them to metadata synchronization.
