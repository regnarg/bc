  * SQLite WAL mode

      - event merging
      - deliberate sleeping to facilitate merging and reduce context-switches
  * Finalized Koƒçkopes reconciliation
      - use hashes as keys instead of original IDs
      - use XOR of values and a different hash instead of a Merkle tree
        (same as IBF does)

# Style / Form

  * Citing and links
      - The syntactic (or nonsyntactic) role of citations in sentence structure.
        Square-brackets vs. what the template does.
      - Citation as a confirmation for a statement (like square brackets on wikipedia)
        X "go see this!"
      - Linking to places in  the kernel source?
      - Linking to software homepages?
      - Linking to manual pages?
  * Saner page numbering that corresponds to PDF pages: is it allowable?
  * Usage of \noindent. E.g. in "the term inode is overloaded..." Is that correct?
    Essentially everywhere when not preceded by another paragraph?
  * ext2/3/4?
  * filesystem X file system
  * filesystem X filesystem type
